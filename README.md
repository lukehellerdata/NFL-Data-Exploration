These files are sets of code that I am working on for two main reasons:
1. To highlight my ability to manipulate, clean, organize, and visualize data using python
2. To help me contine to learn new functions within python with the goal of furthering my data analysis career

I am primarily using the book 'Football Analytics with Python & R: Learning Data Science Through the Lens of Sports'.
